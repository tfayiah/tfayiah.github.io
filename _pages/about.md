# Tamba Fayiah Bio

*** Educational Background ***
I hold a Master of Applied Statistics from Pennsylvania State University, where I graduated in August 2023. My academic journey began with a B.S. in Mathematics (magna cum laude) from the University of Liberia. Additionally, I have earned several professional diplomas, including an Advanced Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Research & Data Management from James Lind Institute, and certifications in Data Science, Management & Security from Oxford University.

*** Professional Experience ***
Currently, I serve as an Information Management Officer at UNICEF Liberia, where I lead efforts to enhance data systems, integrate indicators, and improve community-based information systems. My role involves establishing baseline nutrition data, ensuring data quality, and developing user-friendly information products such as dashboards and statistical reports.

Previously, I worked as a Biostatistician at the Partnership for Research on Infectious Diseases and Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL). In this role, I developed and deployed data collection and information management systems during emergencies, provided statistical methodology support for clinical studies, and led a team of junior data managers. My contributions included developing statistical analysis plans, conducting complex data analyses, and mentoring staff.

I have also served as a Statistician and M&E Specialist Consultant at the Institute of Population Studies, University of Liberia, where I led the design and implementation of M&E systems for health programs. My work involved regular data collection, analysis, and reporting on health indicators to inform decision-making.

*** Research Contributions ***
My research contributions span a wide range of epidemiological and public health topics. Notably, I played a crucial role in a longitudinal cohort study on the clinical sequelae among Ebola survivors, resulting in a publication in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. I have also been involved in evaluating the diagnostic performance of COVID-19 tests, studying maternal healthcare satisfaction, and examining COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in Liberia.

In my current role at UNICEF, I am involved in several ongoing research initiatives, including establishing baseline nutrition data, developing M&E frameworks, and conducting geospatial analyses to identify areas of high need for targeted health interventions.

*** Publications and Presentations ***
I have contributed to the writing and publication of three manuscripts, enhancing the body of research on infectious diseases in Liberia. My work has been presented at various scientific conferences, including the Emmet A. Dennis Scientific Conference and the West Africa Clinical Research Consultum.

*** Research Interests ***
As an aspiring PhD candidate in Biostatistics, my research interests lie at the intersection of advanced statistical methods, machine learning, and their applications in clinical research and public health. My goal is to develop innovative statistical approaches that can enhance the design, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials and epidemiological studies, ultimately improving patient care and public health decision-making.

*** Skills and Expertise ***
I possess a diverse skill set in data analysis, statistical programming, and research communication. My technical proficiencies include R, Python, SAS, Stata, and various data management tools. I am also experienced in developing and implementing monitoring and evaluation frameworks, conducting geospatial analyses, and integrating multi-modal data in biomedical research.

*** Commitment to Public Health ***
Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong commitment to public health, particularly in resource-limited settings. My grassroots experience in malaria eradication efforts in a refugee camp and my volunteer work during the Ebola outbreak have shaped my dedication to improving health outcomes through rigorous research and community engagement.

I am excited about the prospect of furthering my research through a PhD program in Biostatistics and Epidemiology. I believe that my educational background, professional experiences, and research contributions make me a strong candidate for such a program. I am eager to collaborate with experts in the field and contribute to advancements in public health and biostatistics.
