## Educational Background

I hold a Master of Applied Statistics from Pennsylvania State University USA, where I graduated in August 2023. My academic journey began with a B.S. in Mathematics (magna cum laude) from the University of Liberia. Additionally, I have earned several professional diplomas, including an Advanced Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Research & Data Management from James Lind Institute, and certifications in Data Science, Management & Security from Oxford University and several others.

Furthermore, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Technology with a focus on Software Development at Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester, NH, USA.


## Professional Experience

Currently, I serve as an Information Management Officer at UNICEF Liberia, where I lead efforts to enhance data systems, integrate indicators, and improve community-based information systems. My role involves establishing baseline nutrition data, ensuring data quality, and developing user-friendly information products such as dashboards and statistical reports.

Previously, I worked as a Biostatistician at the Partnership for Research on Infectious Diseases and Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL). In this role, I developed and deployed data collection and information management systems during emergencies, provided statistical methodology support for clinical studies, and led a team of junior data managers. My contributions included developing statistical analysis plans, conducting complex data analyses, and mentoring staff.

I have also served as a Statistician and M&E Specialist Consultant at the Institute of Population Studies, University of Liberia, where I led the design and implementation of M&E systems for health programs. My work involved regular data collection, analysis, and reporting on health indicators to inform decision-making.

## Commitment to Public Health

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong commitment to public health, particularly in resource-limited settings. My grassroots experience in malaria eradication efforts in a refugee camp and my volunteer work during the Ebola outbreak have shaped my dedication to improving health outcomes through rigorous research and community engagement.
